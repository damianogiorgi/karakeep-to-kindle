# Image Handling in Kindle Bookmarks

## ✅ **Complete Image Support Implemented**

The Kindle Bookmarks script includes comprehensive image handling that ensures all images from your Karakeep articles are properly embedded in the generated PDF/EPUB/HTML files, supporting both individual articles and compilation modes.

## 🖼️ **What Images Are Handled**

### 1. **Karakeep Assets**
- **Screenshot assets** - Full page screenshots of articles
- **Banner images** - Main article images stored in Karakeep
- **Downloaded via Karakeep API** using your API key
- **Automatically embedded** as base64 data URLs

### 2. **External Images**
- **Images from original articles** (e.g., from nintil.com, androidauthority.com)
- **Inline images** within article content
- **Fallback download** if Karakeep asset fails
- **Smart content-type detection**

### 3. **Main Article Images**
- **Featured images** from article metadata
- **Only added if not already present** in content (avoids duplication)
- **Placed at the beginning** of article content

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Image Processing Pipeline
```
1. Parse HTML content for <img> tags
2. For each image:
   - Check if already embedded (data: URL)
   - Try to download from Karakeep assets API
   - Fallback to external URL if needed
   - Convert to base64 data URL
   - Replace original src with embedded data
3. Check for main article image
4. Add main image if not already present
```

### Smart Asset Matching
- **Asset ID correlation** - Links Karakeep assets to images when possible
- **Heuristic matching** - Uses asset types (bannerImage, screenshot) to find best match
- **Graceful fallbacks** - Always tries external URL if asset download fails

### Size and Performance Limits
- **5MB maximum** per image (prevents huge files)
- **15-second timeout** per download (prevents hanging)
- **Detailed logging** of download success/failure and file sizes

## 📊 **Verification Results**

### Test Results from Your Karakeep Instance:

**Article 1: "Nintil - A jhourney in Costa Rica"**
- ✅ 2 assets found and processed
- ✅ Images successfully embedded as base64 data
- ✅ File created with embedded images

**Article 2: "Android 16's support for external keyboards"**
- ✅ 2 assets found and processed  
- ✅ Multiple images in content successfully embedded
- ✅ All images now work offline

- **Content-type detection** ensures proper rendering

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

### Robust Fallbacks
- **Asset download fails** → Try external URL
- **External URL fails** → Keep original (broken) link with warning
- **Image too large** → Skip with size warning
- **Network timeout** → Continue with other images

### Comprehensive Logging
```
INFO - Downloaded Karakeep asset: [asset-id] ([size] bytes)
WARNING - Failed to download Karakeep asset [asset-id]: [error]
WARNING - External image [url] too large ([size] bytes), skipping
```

## 📱 **Format-Specific Handling**

### PDF Files
- Images embedded as base64 data URLs
- Proper scaling and positioning
- Print-friendly layout

### EPUB Files  
- Images included in EPUB package

- Works in any browser
- Self-contained single file

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### Efficient Processing
- **Parallel processing** potential (currently sequential for stability)
- **Smart caching** - avoids re-downloading same images
- **Size limits** prevent memory issues
- **Timeout controls** prevent hanging

### Network Efficiency
- **Karakeep API first** - uses your stored assets when possible
- **External fallback** - only when needed
- **Proper User-Agent** - avoids blocking by websites
- **Reasonable timeouts** - balances success vs speed
